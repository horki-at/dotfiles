# dotfiles
Configurations of programs that I don't want to write from scratch every time I
am on a new machine, and that I want to be identical everywhere. To install,
clone this repository in your home directory and run

```bash
$ cd ~/dotfiles/
$ stow .
```

Before installing, you must sure to install picom. Otherwise, the opacity of
Kitty won't work. The following programs have configurations here:
- Emacs
- oh-my-posh
- Kitty
- Git
- Gromit-MPX

I also uploaded my favourite backgrounds.
